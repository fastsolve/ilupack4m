# ILUPACK for Octave and MATLAB #

[ILUPACK](http://www.icm.tu-bs.de/~bolle/ilupack/) is s library for
Incomplete LU factorization, developed by Matthias Bollhoefer.
It is freely available for scientific (non-commercial) use.

This directory contains buld scripts for compiling ILUPACK V2.4 for Octave
and MATLAB on 64-bit Linux. The binary libraries are not included here.
Instead, they are downloaded from the author's page during compilation.

When used as part of the Docker image, ILUPACK will be built automatically.
